All code necessary to produce the figures in this paper are in the Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange jupyter notebook. Some of these figures are based on simulation results produced using the LFA_Sim.py, HFLSA_Sim.py, and HFCSA_Sim.py notebooks. Note that these simulations were performed on a server over the course of multiple days.
